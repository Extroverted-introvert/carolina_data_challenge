# carolina_data_challenge
Official Submission to Carolina Data Science Challenge

## Checkout the app at [Heroku](https://peace-watch.herokuapp.com/)

## Inspiration
<p>What if can quatify the happiness of a place in just minutes.<br>
The power of Big Data and AI enables us to tap into data feed of a region and topic and use that to do map out the sentiment of area.<br>
Similarly on opposite end of the spectrum, what if there was a way to easily identify the sheer magnitude of loss and destruction, our 3D visualization enables us to do so.</p>

## What it does
<p>There are basically two components to the solution<br>

1. War Visualizer: a 3D plot of war data, quantifying the damage and region most affected by violent skirmishes<br>
2. Sentiment Quantifier: An app that feteches twwet data using twiiter api with specific parameters, then run it through sentiment analyser and assign a score<br>
</p>


## How we built it
<p>Built using Django platform in Python. The check the repository for the sources used for visualizations.<br>
The sentiment analyser was trained using Tensorflow Twitter Dataset<br>
</p>

## Challenges we ran into
<p> It was my first time deploying a CRUD application to Heroku</p>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
<p>Driving public attention to the sheer cost and loss caused due terrorsim, and quantifying the high military spendings accross the world<br>
Creating a solution that tracks and display general population sentiment depending on topic and location</p>  

## What we learned
<p>
The following can be enumerated as key learnings:<br>

1. Django Development
2. Plotly 3-D Visualizations
3. Tweepy Twitter Library   

## What's next for Peace Watch
<p>The future work on the project is:<br>

1. Finetuning Prediction Methodology
2. Adding further location support
